![DS](https://github.com/Ting-DS/stackoverflow_survey_analysis/blob/main/DS.png)


This project aims to use Stack Overflow data (150,000+ responses) from 2021 to 2023 to clarify the relationship between career development in data science and education level and its related factors:

1. What are the educational backgrounds in various data science positions (e.g., data scientist, data analyst, data engineer, machine learning engineer), and how do they differ?

2. How do salaries vary across different data science roles based on educational levels? Is age a significant factor in these differences?

3. What is the relationship between salary and years of professional coding experience, considering education levels, company sizes, and job types?

These insights will not only inform your career choices in data science, but spark your passion for the world of data science, let's started!

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 4 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions, each addressing a specific inquiry. These notebooks delve into data analysis, with one dedicated to data cleaning. Markdown cells provide guided insights, unraveling steps as you navigate through."

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the **Medium** post available [here](https://medium.com/@LobsterTing/revealing-data-science-careers-is-a-phd-a-necessity-487ac40ceac6).
